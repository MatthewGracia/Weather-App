Weather App

This is a simple weather app that retrieves weather information from a weather API and displays it to the user. The app is built using JavaScript and fetches data from the Weather App API.

Features
Retrieve current weather information based on location.
Display the temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed.
Allow users to search for weather information for different locations.
Automatically detect and display the user's current location (with permission).
Prerequisites
Before running the weather app, make sure you have the following:

A modern web browser that supports JavaScript.
An API key from the Weather App API. You can sign up for a free API key on their website.
Getting Started
To run the weather app locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
Open the index.html file in your web browser.

Open the script.js file and replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key from the Weather App API:

javascript
Copy code
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
Save the changes.

You're ready to use the weather app! Enter a location in the search bar to retrieve weather information.

How It Works
The weather app utilizes the fetch API in JavaScript to make HTTP requests to the Weather App API. It sends a request to the API endpoint with the user's location or the searched location and the API key. The API returns a JSON response containing the weather information for the specified location.

The JavaScript code parses the JSON response and updates the weather information on the webpage dynamically. It extracts relevant data such as temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed from the response and displays it to the user.

The app also includes a geolocation feature that requests permission to access the user's current location. If the user grants permission, the app retrieves the weather information for their current location automatically.
